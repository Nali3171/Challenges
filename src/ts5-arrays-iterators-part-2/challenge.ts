/* JS5 builds on the previous challenges and adds the use of MORE Array iterators, Arrays, For Loops, Conditionals (If, else, switch)

/* 
  All challenges in this repository are separated into four levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert.
  The expectation is to complete all Foundation level challenges, with Intermediate and upwards pushing your knowledge
