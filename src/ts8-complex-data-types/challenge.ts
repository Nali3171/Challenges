/* This challenge build upon previous knowledge and introduces the concept of complex data types (arrays of objects) */

/* 
  All challenges in this repository are separated into four levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert.
  The expectation is to complete all Foundation level challenges, with Intermediate and upwards pushing your knowledge
  and may require you to google things in order to solve them. If you find an answer online somewhere, be kind and
  share it with the group!
